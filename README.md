KerbExpressions
===============
Pre-alpha right now. 

If you run this, it uses all the number keys (above the keyboard) to do various things to EVA kerbals.

Features:
* Push 7 to insta-ragdoll
* Push 3 to toggle helmet on/off (no death at the moment)
* Push 6 to manually control expressions, then 1 for whee, 2 for panic, or 0 for neutral.

Other things, but it'll all change.
